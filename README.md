# CHIP-8-Emulator

What is this?
-------------
- This CHIP-8 emulator was made to be educational, so that I could learn the inner workings of emulators. It is meant to be a stepping stone to other emulators.
- I decided to go with CHIP-8 due to its simplicity and small instruction set and straight forward graphics in comparison to other systems such as the Gameboy or NES.


How can I run this?
-------------------
- Currently only works on MacOS and possibly on Linux (to be tested)
- Simple DirectMedia Layer 2 (SDL 2) is a requisite. If the libs and includes are in a different folder, you may need to modify the make file so that GCC can refer to them correctly.
- Run the command <code>make</code> when navigated to the <code>src</code> directory in the Terminal.
